# FlashCard - Udacity's React Fundamentals ND Project #3
This is my solution for the third project of the Udacity's React Fundamental Nanodegree.

## Description
The App is a mobile application to manage flashcards.

## Installation
The App is build in React Native and uses [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) and [React Native Elements](https://react-native-training.github.io/react-native-elements/) for styling, but you can find dependencies in the package.json file.
To install and run the app follow these steps:

```
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/robbisg/udacity-react-flashcard flashcards
cd flashcards

# Install dependecies
npm install

# Start the App
npm start

```

You need a virtual device emulator, we suggest to use [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/) on a Samsung Galaxy S6 API 25, and then follow the instructions on the screen.
